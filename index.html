          <h2>The Training Scene</h2>
          <p>
            one scene present in almost any martial arts movie is the training
            scene. Whether it's the wax-on, wax-off training in the karate kid,
            or the brutal flexibility training in kickboxer, the training scene
            is a key part of showing the dedication and hard work these
            characters must go through in order to grow and achieve their goals.
