              a martial arts tournament to take down a crime-syndicate. great.
              Revenge stories are a staple of the martial arts genre and this
              movie is no different as Bruce Lee's motivation in this film is
              the death of his sister. Full of action, intrigue, and more
              action, this movie perfectly displays everything that makes a
              Bruce Lee movie great.

              Eric Sloane, an American kickboxing pro travels to Thailand to
              seek revenge on Tong Po for paralysing his brother. In Thailand,
              Sloane learns the ancient art of muay thai from a master before
              tangling with a criminal organization. While full of cliches, this
              movie is a great watch thanks to Van Damme's over the top
              performance and athleticism.

          <h2>The Training Scene</h2>
          <p>
            One scene present in almost any martial arts movie is the training
            scene. Whether it's the wax-on, wax-off training in the karate kid,
            or the brutal flexibility training in kickboxer, the training scene
            is a key part of showing the hard work and dedication these
            characters must go through in order to grow and achieve their goals.
